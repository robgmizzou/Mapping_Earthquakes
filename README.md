### Earthquake Mapping Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
Using USGS GeoJSON data, we have plotted scaled geograhic representations of all earthquakes with a magnitutude of over 4.5 in the last week.  By adding these to the map, we can use this data overlayed with tectonic plate locations to dispay clusters of activity around the globe.

## Approach
Using JavaScript and D#.js, we can retreive the base data, and use Leaflet to plot the data throough Mapbox for an interactive module to present our findings.
